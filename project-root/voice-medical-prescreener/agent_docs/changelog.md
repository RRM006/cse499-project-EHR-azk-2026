# changelog.md — Session-by-Session History

> The running memory of the project. **Newest entry at the top.**
> One short entry per session. This is what a new session reads to remember
> "what happened recently and why", so we never re-explain or re-litigate.

> Template for each entry:

## Session 2 — 2026-06-19 — Phase 0 Steps 3–5: correction service + API + frontend
- Did: Built the correction service (Step 3): `services/correction/base.py`
  (`Corrector` ABC) + `openai_compatible.py` (`OpenAICompatibleCorrector` +
  `build_corrector()` + strict prompt + manual `__main__` live check) and
  `test_corrector.py` (4 offline guards). Built the API (Step 4):
  `schemas/transcript.py`, `api/routes_transcripts.py` (`POST /api/correct`,
  `GET /api/transcripts`), and `main.py` (lifespan `init_db`, `/health`, serves
  frontend or a placeholder). Built the frontend (Step 5): `frontend/index.html`,
  `app.js` (Web Speech API bn-BD, interim grey / final verbatim), `styles.css`.
  Fixed `.claude/launch.json` to use the venv Python. Ran the server via the
  preview tool and verified the page renders with no console errors.
- Decided: `POST /api/correct` persists RAW *before* calling the LLM, so raw
  survives a correction failure (502 with raw kept); misconfig fails fast (500).
  Recorded as ADR-0013.
- Broke / problem: `launch.json` first used system `python` (no uvicorn) → fixed to
  `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` (Windows-specific; Arch needs `.venv/bin/python`).
- Deferred: Live Gemini call NOT auto-run (spends free-tier quota) — left as a
  manual check for the human. No automated test for `/api/correct` (would hit the
  network). Groq/OpenRouter still interface-only. Frontend = plain HTML/JS (React later).
- Next: Step 6 — human runs the end-to-end live mic test in Chrome on both
  machines and collects ~50 sample utterances. See `current_task.md`.

## Session 1 — 2026-06-19 — Phase 0 scaffolding + backend skeleton (Steps 1–2)
- Did: Approved the Phase 0 plan, then built the foundation (not a throwaway
  demo folder): `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, `backend/.env` + `.env.example`,
  and the backend skeleton — `backend/app/core/config.py` (pydantic-settings),
  `backend/app/db/` (database.py, models.py `Utterance`, repository.py), and
  `backend/tests/test_raw_immutable.py`. Installed deps in `.venv` and ran tests.
- Decided: Build the real `backend/` + `frontend/` structure now (foundation for
  the full app); SQLite via a repository layer; one FastAPI server serving the
  frontend; mic + manual-text fallback; correction via the OpenAI-compatible
  client pointed at Gemini (swappable). Recorded as ADR-0009 to ADR-0011.
- Broke / problem: Pinned `SQLAlchemy==2.0.36` crashed on Python 3.14.4
  (typing-union `__getitem__` bug). Fixed by upgrading to `2.0.51` and re-pinning.
- Deferred: Gemini code + the actual network call, API routes, frontend
  (Steps 3–5). Groq/OpenRouter fallback (interface only). The human still needs to
  REGENERATE the pasted Gemini key and put it in `backend/.env`.
- Next: Step 3 — correction service (`Corrector` ABC + `OpenAICompatibleCorrector`
  with the strict correct-only prompt). See `current_task.md`.

## Session 0 — 2026-06-18 — Project setup & memory system
- Did: Created the project memory system: `CLAUDE.md` plus `agent_docs/`
  (constitution, milestone_log, current_task, changelog, test_log, decisions,
  codebase_map, session_protocol). No code yet.
- Decided: Locked in the starting stack and key choices — recorded as
  ADR-0001 to ADR-0008 in `decisions.md`.
- Broke / problem: None (nothing built yet).
- Deferred: All actual coding. AMD-GPU acceleration deferred (CPU-only first).
  Real Bangla-fine-tuned model deferred to Phase 2.
- Next: Build the Phase 0 demo (browser Web Speech API live Bangla transcription
  + free-LLM correction). Plan it with the human before coding.
  See `current_task.md`.
