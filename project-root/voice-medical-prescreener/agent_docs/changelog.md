# changelog.md — Session-by-Session History

> The running memory of the project. **Newest entry at the top.**
> One short entry per session. This is what a new session reads to remember
> "what happened recently and why", so we never re-explain or re-litigate.

> Template for each entry:

> - Did: <what we actually built or changed>
> - Decided: <any decision; also add it to decisions.md>

## Session 1 — 2026-06-19 — Phase 0 scaffolding + backend skeleton (Steps 1–2)
- Did: Approved the Phase 0 plan, then built the foundation (not a throwaway
  demo folder): `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, `backend/.env` + `.env.example`,
  and the backend skeleton — `backend/app/core/config.py` (pydantic-settings),
  `backend/app/db/` (database.py, models.py `Utterance`, repository.py), and
  `backend/tests/test_raw_immutable.py`. Installed deps in `.venv` and ran tests.
- Decided: Build the real `backend/` + `frontend/` structure now (foundation for
  the full app); SQLite via a repository layer; one FastAPI server serving the
  frontend; mic + manual-text fallback; correction via the OpenAI-compatible
  client pointed at Gemini (swappable). Recorded as ADR-0009 to ADR-0011.
- Broke / problem: Pinned `SQLAlchemy==2.0.36` crashed on Python 3.14.4
  (typing-union `__getitem__` bug). Fixed by upgrading to `2.0.51` and re-pinning.
- Deferred: Gemini code + the actual network call, API routes, frontend
  (Steps 3–5). Groq/OpenRouter fallback (interface only). The human still needs to
  REGENERATE the pasted Gemini key and put it in `backend/.env`.
- Next: Step 3 — correction service (`Corrector` ABC + `OpenAICompatibleCorrector`
  with the strict correct-only prompt). See `current_task.md`.

## Session 0 — 2026-06-18 — Project setup & memory system
- Did: Created the project memory system: `CLAUDE.md` plus `agent_docs/`
  (constitution, milestone_log, current_task, changelog, test_log, decisions,
  codebase_map, session_protocol). No code yet.
- Decided: Locked in the starting stack and key choices — recorded as
  ADR-0001 to ADR-0008 in `decisions.md`.
- Broke / problem: None (nothing built yet).
- Deferred: All actual coding. AMD-GPU acceleration deferred (CPU-only first).
  Real Bangla-fine-tuned model deferred to Phase 2.
- Next: Build the Phase 0 demo (browser Web Speech API live Bangla transcription
  + free-LLM correction). Plan it with the human before coding.
  See `current_task.md`.
